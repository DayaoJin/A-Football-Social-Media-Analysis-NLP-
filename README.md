# A-Football-Social-Media-Analysis-NLP-

This analysis uses Facebook and Instagram datasets to explore social media engagement patterns through NLP techniques. The project emphasizes understanding the relationship between text content, sentiment, and engagement metrics across two platforms.

The analysis addresses three primary research questions:

1. How can view counts from multiple platforms be combined to provide a unified engagement metric?
This analysis combines Instagram and Facebook view counts over a shared timeframe. The combined dataset was visualized for the latest 30 days, allowing identification of engagement trends across platforms.

2. How can social media news posts be grouped into meaningful topics?
Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the project groups news posts into topics, revealing themes that frequently appear in social media content. Text preprocessing, including lemmatization and stopword removal, was essential to this analysis. Topic modeling outputs the top terms associated with each identified theme.

3. Does sentiment or text length significantly affect engagement across platforms?
Sentiment analysis categorizes posts into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiment classes to examine if sentiment affects view counts. Text length statistics were also analyzed to investigate whether content length impacts engagement differently on Facebook and Instagram.
